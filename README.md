# JuniorPanel

## Objetive

I realized that Junior Company in my University doesn't possessed a system that can manage absences of employers on meetings, progression of development of projects and disclose meetings and the responsibilities that each one have, so I created the JuniorPanel, a small and simple system based on SPA (Single-Page-Application) without lib (Vue, React or Angular) for do this.

### Used languages/technologies
HTML, CSS (SASS preprocessor), JS (jQuery) and Firebase.
